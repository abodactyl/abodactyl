### 🌸 Hey, I'm Abby!

💡 I'm a developer and pixel artist who works primarily with **Java** and the **JVM** (I am also experienced with NodeJS and Python). <br />
🌍 I've developed for **20+ major Minecraft and Discord communities**, and built hundreds of web apps including **a custom streaming service**! <br />
📖 In my spare time, I'm studying **music production** (as I play guitar, piano and bass, and I also sing), and **building my own indie RPG game**... <br />
